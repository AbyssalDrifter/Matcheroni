<div class="divider">Parsing JSON with Matcheroni & Parseroni</div>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/aappleby/Matcheroni/blob/main/matcheroni/Matcheroni.hpp">Matcheroni</a> is a minimalist, zero-dependency, single-header C++20 library for doing pattern matching using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs)</a>. PEGs are similar to regular expressions, but both more and less powerful.
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/aappleby/Matcheroni/blob/main/matcheroni/Parseroni.hpp">Parseroni</a> is a companion single-header library that can capture the content of Matcheroni patterns and assemble them into concrete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree">parse trees</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we'll be using Matcheroni and Parseroni to build a JSON parser in less than 100 lines of code. The parser passes conformance tests, parses JSON at a gigabyte a second, and compiles down to ~10k of machine code in under a second.
</p>























<div class="divider">Parsing JSON, Step 0: "Hello World"</div>

<p>
But before we jump into JSON syntax, let's start with the Matcheroni equivalent of "Hello World".
</p>
<p>
The code below is exactly as it appears in the Matcheroni repo and has been compiled into WASM via Emscripten. The panels on the right are live - type into the top box and you'll see the program's output in the lower box.
</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="output_header header_bar">json_tut0a output</div>
    <div class="output_pane"></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Let's go through this line-by-line once and we'll then skip over the details in the later steps.</p>

<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
#include "matcheroni/Matcheroni.hpp"
#include "matcheroni/Utilities.hpp"

using namespace matcheroni;
</pre>

<p>
  We're including <span class="highlight">Matcheroni.hpp</span> and <span class="highlight">Utilities.hpp</span>, which contains various helper functions that make testing easier. The main code is in the <span class="highlight">matcheroni</span> namespace, utilities are in <span class="highlight">matcheroni::utils</span>, and there are prefab patterns for various matching tasks in the <span class="highlight">matcheroni::cookbook</span> namespace.
</p>

<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
  std::string input = utils::read(argv[1]);
  TextSpan text = utils::to_span(input);
</pre>

<p>
Matcheroni operates on spans of atoms, which are roughly equivalent to slices in Rust or Python. In this case our atoms are just characters, though they could be any type. <span class="highlight">TextSpan</span> is just a typedef for <span class="highlight">matcheroni::Span&lt;char&gt;</span>.
</p>
<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
  using pattern = Seq< Lit<"Hello">, Atom<' '>, Lit<"World"> >;
</pre>

<p>
The pattern we're matching is a sequence consisting of the literal string "Hello", followed by a single space, followed by the literal string "World". Our pattern expresses that in Matcheroni syntax.<br>
</p>

<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
  TextMatchContext ctx;
</pre>

<p>
  Matcheroni patterns are themselves stateless, but in most non-trivial uses of Matcheroni we're going to want to keep track of some application-specific context. Matcheroni's <span class="highlight">TextMatchContext</span> is a convenience class that contains the minimal amount of code needed to make things work.
</p>

<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
struct TextMatchContext {

  // We cast to unsigned char as our ranges are generally going to be unsigned.
  static int atom_cmp(char a, int b) { return (unsigned char)a - b; }

  // Checkpoint/Rewind does nothing as it doesn't interact with trace_depth.
  void* checkpoint() { return nullptr; }
  void rewind(void* bookmark) {}

  // Tracing requires us to keep track of the nesting depth in the context.
  int trace_depth = 0;
};
</pre>

<p>
  You are free to provide your own context object as long as it implements three functions that Matcheroni requires - <span class="highlight">atom_cmp()</span> to compare atoms (ala strcmp()), <span class="highlight">checkpoint()</span> to generate an opaque token representing the current context's state, and <span class="highlight">rewind()</span> to restore the context to a previous state. <span class="highlight">TextMatchContext</span> has no state to save or restore, so its <span class="highlight">checkpoint()</span> and <span class="highlight">rewind()</span> are no-ops.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to use <span class="highlight">utils::TraceText&lt;&gt;</span> for debugging (see step 3 of this tutorial), your context also needs a "trace_depth".
</p>


<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
  TextSpan tail = pattern::match(ctx, text);
</pre>

<p>
The 'tail' return value from pattern::match() is a span representing the <span class="highlight">_remainder_</span> of the input text if the pattern matched, or a <span class="highlight">(nullptr, &lt;match failure location&gt;)</span> pair if the pattern did not match.
</p>

<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
  utils::print_summary(text, tail, 50);
</pre>

<p>
  And 'print_summary' just displays a colorized version of the match results.
</p>


<div class="question">
Hey, wait a second - what _is_ 'pattern', exactly?<br>
It looks like a type, but there are words in it.
</div>
<p>
We can get into it in more detail later, but essentially the pattern is just a tree of templated structs, each of which has a static <span class="highlight">match()</span> method that does some matching work of its own and then calls into the <span class="highlight">match()</span> methods of the template arguments.</p>
<p>
When we call <span class="highlight">pattern::match(ctx, text)</span>, we're calling into the outermost sequence template's <span class="highlight">Seq&lt;&gt;::match()</span>, which then calls into <span class="highlight">Lit&lt;&gt;::match()</span>, then <span class="highlight">Atom&lt;&gt;::match()</span>, and so on. The strings "Hello", "World", and the space character are arguments to the terminal templates so that the instantiated match() methods have something to compare against.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, it's a bit weird - but it works quite well. The resulting template names are enormous, but the code is tiny and surprisingly fast - nearly as fast as what you'd get if you wrote a recursive-descent parser by hand, except with (hopefully) fewer bugs.<br>
</p>









<div class="divider">Parsing JSON, Step 1: Matching Numbers</div>

<p>
Now for a real-world example - parsing JSON. We'll break the grammar into a few chunks to make it a bit less overwhelming. Below we've defined a struct <span class="highlight">JsonMatcher</span> that uses the built-in Matcheroni patterns to match JSON-valid numbers. The grammar below is slightly modified from the version on <a href="http://json.org">JSON.org</a> (for reasons that will be explained later) but is equivalent to it.
</p>

<div class="live_code" id="json_tut1a">
  <div class="left_panel">
    <div class="header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut1a.cpp</div>
    <div class="source_pane language-cpp"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="right_panel">
    <div class="input_header header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut1a.input</div>
    <div class="input_pane language-json" contenteditable="true"></div>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="output_header header_bar">json_tut1a output</div>
    <div class="output_pane"></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  If you're familiar with regular expressions this should be easy to decipher. <span class="highlight">Range&lt;a,z&gt;</span> is <span class="highlight">[a-z]</span>, <span class="highlight">Some&lt;x&gt;</span> is <span class="highlight">x+</span>,
  <span class="highlight">Any&lt;x&gt;</span> is <span class="highlight">x*</span>, <span class="highlight">Opt&lt;x&gt;</span> is <span class="highlight">x?</span>, etecetera. Unlike regular expressions, we can break our pattern up into named reusable pieces - the Matcheroni patterns aren't as concise as regular expressions, but they're easier to read.
</p>
<p>
The static member function <span class="highlight">JsonMatcher::match()</span> is a "matcher function" in Matcheroni speak. Matcher functions can do whatever they want, but they must have this function signature:
</p>
<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
template &lt;typename context, typename atom&gt;
using matcher_function = Span&lt;atom&gt; (*)(context& ctx, Span&lt;atom&gt; body);</pre>
<p>
  Structs that implement a static <span class="highlight">match()</span> method with this signature can be incorporated into other Matcheroni patterns just like the built-in ones: <span class="highlight">Seq&lt;Some&lt;JsonMatcher&gt;...&gt;</span>. Being able to re-use chunks of a grammar in that fashion can be quite handy.
</p>
<p>
  Do note that we're not converting the matched string to a floating-point number, only verifying that the input string matches the number pattern defined in the JSON spec. Handling data conversion is farther down in this tutorial.
</p>


<div class="divider">Parsing JSON, Step 2: Matching Strings & Keywords</div>
<p>
  With numbers taken care of, we can try matching strings and keywords. These are slightly more complicated than numbers, but the patterns here are still almost identical to the <a href="http://json.org">JSON.org</a> versions. We'll also extend <span class="highlight">JsonMatcher::match()</span> to handle whitespace-delimited sequences of numbers, strings, and keywords so that our interactive demo can be a bit more interesting.
</p>

<div class="live_code" id="json_tut1b">
  <div class="left_panel">
    <div class="header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut1b.cpp</div>
    <div class="source_pane language-cpp"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="right_panel">
    <div class="input_header header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut1b.input</div>
    <div class="input_pane language-json" contenteditable="true"></div>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="output_header header_bar">json_tut1b output</div>
    <div class="output_pane"></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  There's a couple interesting things to look at here. The <span class="highlight">hex</span> pattern uses multiple ranges in one template just like <span class="highlight">[0-9a-fA-F]</span> in regex. The <span class="highlight">escape</span> pattern uses <span class="highlight">Charset&lt;&gt;</span> which is just a more concise <span class="highlight">Atom&lt;...&gt;</span> and <span class="highlight">Rep&lt;&gt;</span> which is equivalent to regex's <span class="highlight">a{N}</span>.
</p>
<p>
  That <span class="highlight">Range&lt;0x0020, 0x10FFFF&gt;</span> though - we're matching plain 8-bit characters, so why the huge constant? Well, that's what's in the JSON spec, and we're not actually matching 8-bit characters... yet.
</p>
<p>
  Something you might not have noticed is that nowhere in our Matcheroni patterns do we mention characters or bytes or any concrete type aside from the implicit type of the embedded constants themselves. The key that binds a Matcheroni pattern to an actual atom type is the <span class="highlight">atom_cmp()</span> method of the context mentioned earlier.
</p>
<p>
  The <span class="highlight">Atom&lt;&gt;</span> pattern doesn't match characters, it matches atoms - and atoms are anything that can be compared using the <span class="highlight">atom_cmp()</span> method provided in the context. So if we wanted to match floating point numbers using <span class="highlight">Atom&lt;3.14159&gt;</span> and <span class="highlight">static int atom_cmp(float a, float b)</span>, that would work equally as well as matching characters.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, if the matcher function's signature was something like <span class="highlight">static UTF32Span match(UTF32MatchContext& ctx, UTF32Span body)</span>, we could pass in UTF-32-encoded text and the matcher will do the right thing (or at least it should, I haven't checked this particular case yet).
</p>
<p>
  The (work-in-progress) C99 <a href="../../examples/c_lexer">lexer</a> and <a href="../../examples/c_parser">parser</a> in Matcheroni's example folder take advantage of this functionality - the lexer matches plain text and produces tokens, the parser matches tokens and produces parse nodes. There are probably other interesting ways of using Matcheroni on things other than text - perhaps parsing binary data, or decoding bus transactions from oscilloscope traces?
</p>

<div class="divider">JSON Part 3: Matching Containers</div>

<p>
  To finish out the JSON grammar, we need to add support for arrays and dictionaries. We also need a generic <span class="highlight">value</span> pattern that can match any possible value in a key-value pair. While we're at it, we'll add debugging support using the <span class="highlight">utils::TraceText&lt;&gt;</span> template.
</p>
<div class="live_code" id="json_tut1c">
  <div class="left_panel">
    <div class="header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut1c.cpp</div>
    <div class="source_pane language-cpp"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="right_panel">
    <div class="input_header header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut1c.input</div>
    <div class="input_pane language-json" contenteditable="true"></div>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="output_header header_bar">json_tut1c output</div>
    <div class="output_pane"></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  If you intentionally add some garbage to the input JSON, you'll see in the trace where the matcher fails.
</p>

<p>
  Code-wise, we've got lots of things to look at here. First off, we declare a templated pattern <span class="highlight">list&lt;&gt;</span> so that we can make comma-delimited lists out of our other patterns. Factoring out small patterns like this helps readability in larger programs.
</p>

<p>
  Next we... define a static <span class="highlight">match_value()</span> function that matches types that haven't been declared yet? Yep, that's valid, and it's how we handle recursive patterns.
</p>

<p>
  JSON objects can contain values and JSON values can be objects - the JSON grammar is recursive by definition through the <span class="highlight">value</span> pattern. C++ templates, however, cannot contain themselves as arguments. Instead, we define a static matcher function <span class="highlight">match_value()</span> and wrap it in a <span class="highlight">Ref&lt;&gt;</span> template, which is one of the ways that Matcheroni can call user-defined code.
</p>
<p>
  Member functions are allowed (due to C++ reasons I do not understand) to refer to types in their parent class even before they've been declared. So we can replace template-recursion with call-recursion and everything still compiles. The <span class="highlight">Ref&lt;&gt;</span> template can also call functions on your Context object if needed, which is useful for keeping track of statistics.
</p>
<p>
  With <span class="highlight">value</span> and <span class="highlight">list&lt;&gt;</span> defined, the <span class="highlight">array</span> and <span class="highlight">object</span> patterns aren't too complicated - we match the outermost delimiters surrounding optional whitespace and a comma-delimited list of values or key/value pairs.
</p>
<p>
  To debug our patterns, we can wrap them in <span class="highlight">utils::TraceText&lt;"identifier", pattern&gt;</span>. This will print out a representation of the match state before and after each match() call, as you can see on the right. Tracing generates a _lot_ of output though, so use it sparingly.
</p>

<div class="divider">Parsing JSON, Step 4: Actually Parsing JSON</div>

<p>
  Our JSON matcher works, but we need a JSON _parser_ that will build a parse tree we can iterate over and do useful things with. <a href="https://github.com/aappleby/Matcheroni/blob/main/matcheroni/Parseroni.hpp">Parseroni.hpp</a> provides helper code that makes this fairly straightforward. Parseroni consists of three main parts:
</p>
<p><span class="highlight">NodeBase&lt;&gt;</span> is a mixin-style parse node base class that stores the child/sibling pointers for each parse node, along with a tag string and the span from the matcher.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">NodeContext&lt;&gt;</span> handles all the pointer bookkeeping needed to create parse trees and uses a specialized allocator to minimize the overhead of creating and destroying parse nodes as we work through all our possible matches.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">Capture&lt;&gt;</span> wraps Matcheroni patterns in the same way as <span class="highlight">Trace&lt;&gt;</span> and tells <span class="highlight">NodeContext&lt;&gt;</span> to create a new <span class="highlight">NodeBase&lt;&gt;</span> and add it to the parse tree if the pattern inside it matches.</p>

<p>For convenience, Parseroni provides specialized versions of these for the common case of matching plain text:</p>

<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
// Note that NodeBase&lt;&gt; is a mixin-style class, which means that class X must
// inherit from template&lt;X, ...&gt;.
struct TextParseNode : public NodeBase&lt;TextParseNode, char&gt; {

  // Returns a text representation of this node's contents for debugging.
  // Implementing this method is optional, but print_summary() and similar
  // won't work without it.
  TextSpan as_text_span() const { return span; }
};

// The return value of atom_cmp() must follow strcmp() rules. You can implement
// atom_cmp() multiple times if you have more types of constants to match
// against.
struct TextParseContext : public NodeContext&lt;TextParseNode&gt; {
  static int atom_cmp(char a, int b) {
    return (unsigned char)a - b;
  }
};
</pre>

<p>
And capturing a pattern with them looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="centered code_box language-cpp">
// Matches a key:value pair where 'key' is a string and 'value' is a JSON value.
using pair =
Seq&lt;
  Capture&lt;"key", string, TextParseNode&gt;,
  Opt&lt;space&gt;,
  Atom&lt;':'&gt;,
  Opt&lt;space&gt;,
  Capture&lt;"value", value, TextParseNode&gt;
&gt;;
</pre>

<p>
  If we take the code from the previous example and swap out <span class="highlight">Trace&lt;&gt;</span> with <span class="highlight">Capture&lt;&gt;</span> and <span class="highlight">TextMatchContext</span> with <span class="highlight">TextParseContext</span>, our matcher is now a parser and <span class="highlight">print_summary()</span> can dump out a visualization of the parse tree. Magic! :D
</p>


<div class="live_code" id="json_tut2a">
  <div class="left_panel">
    <div class="header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut2a.cpp</div>
    <div class="source_pane language-cpp"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="right_panel">
    <div class="input_header header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut2a.input</div>
    <div class="input_pane language-json" contenteditable="true"></div>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="output_header header_bar">json_tut2a output</div>
    <div class="output_pane"></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
And that's it, we have a JSON parser in under 100 lines of code. We could probably code-golf it down smaller, but the readability of this version is nice.
</p>
<div class="question">You have a parser, but is it actually correct?</div>
<p>
We can test that. The <a href="https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite">JSONTestSuite</a> repo contains a bunch of known-good and known-bad JSON files that we can use with our parser. The conformance test is in <a href="../../examples/json/json_conformance.cpp">json_conformance.cpp</a> - results are
</p>

<pre class="centered text_box">
Known good pass 95
Known good fail 0
Known bad pass  186
Known bad fail  0
Other pass      31
Other fail      4
Skipped         2
</pre>
<p>
  So we pass everything in the conformance test except for two tests that we have to skip because they crash. The two skipped tests are <a href="https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/blob/master/test_parsing/n_structure_100000_opening_arrays.json">n_structure_100000_opening_arrays.json</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/blob/master/test_parsing/n_structure_open_array_object.json">n_structure_open_array_object.json</a> - both of those create tens of thousands of nested-but-unterminated arrays/objects, and since Matcheroni is a recursive-descent parser it immediately overflows the stack.
</p>
<p>
  Changing Matcheroni to stop using the stack for intermediate parse results would be... very hard, so we're not going to fix that. If you need a parser that can handle arbitrarily large malicious inputs, don't use Matcheroni.
</p>


<div class="divider">Parsing JSON, Step 5: Customization</div>
<p>
So great, we have a JSON parser. It's not very convenient to use though, as it doesn't do any automatic conversion of text into data types like "number" -> float.
</p>
<p>
Earlier I mentioned that Parseroni can make use of user-defined classes for nodes and contexts. Let's create some simple extensions of <span class="highlight">NodeBase&lt;&gt;</span> and <span class="highlight">NodeContext&lt;&gt;</span> so that we have nodes that can contain floating-point numbers instead of just text. We'll replace <span class="highlight">TextParseContext/TextParseNode</span> with our new <span class="highlight">JsonContext/JsonNode</span>, specialize <span class="highlight">JsonNode</span> to create a <span class="highlight">NumberNode</span>, and then make <span class="highlight">Capture&lt;&gt;</span> create <span class="highlight">NumberNodes</span> when it matches a number.
</p>
<div class="live_code" id="json_tut2b">
  <div class="left_panel">
    <div class="header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut2b.cpp</div>
    <div class="source_pane language-cpp"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="right_panel">
    <div class="input_header header_bar">./tutorial/json_tut2b.input</div>
    <div class="input_pane language-json" contenteditable="true"></div>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="output_header header_bar">json_tut2b output</div>
    <div class="output_pane"></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
So now we have our own node and context classes, plus a <span class="highlight">NumberNode</span> that derives from <span class="highlight">JsonNode</span> and calls <span class="highlight">atof()</span> on the text span it receives. To make use of <span class="highlight">NumberNode</span>, we just have to pass it as the third template argument to <span class="highlight">Capture&lt;&gt;</span>.

Yes, this example is a bit silly, but it illustrates how to start building out your own node types and integrating them into an existing grammar.
</p>


<div class="divider">Benchmarking Performance, Code Size, Memory Usage,<br> and Compile Time</div>

<p>
Matcheroni and Parseroni look a bit "magical" in that they do a _lot_ of stuff inside templates, so it's reasonable to be skeptical of its performance. Let's clear up things with some hard numbers.
</p>

<div class="question">So how fast is this parser?</div>
<p>
There's a benchmark in the repo at <a href="../../examples/json/json_benchmark.cpp">json_benchmark.cpp</a> that parses the test JSON files from <a href="https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark">nativejson-benchmark</a> 100 times and reports the median result. These measurements are from json_benchmark compiled using <span class="highlight">-O3 -flto</span> in Ubuntu running under WSL on a Ryzen 5900x.
</p>

<pre class="centered text_box">
With node constructors/destructors disabled:

Byte total 4609770.000000

Parse byte rate  870.227667 megabytes per second
Parse line rate  12.451673 megalines per second
</pre>

<p>
Around a gig a second - a bit more if we disable constructors/destructors, a bit less otherwise. Not bad.
</p>
<p>
Comparing it against the other parsers in the nativejson-benchmark repo is a bit difficult due to some of the tests bit-rotting, but on this machine only "gason", "sajson", and "RapidJson" have parse times in the single-digit milliseconds.
</p>
<p>
To be fair this isn't a 100% apples-to-apples test as the Matcheroni parser isn't doing string->double conversion, but if we add that back in (using a trivial string-to-float implementation) performance is still around 900 megs a second. Don't use stdlib's atof() though, as then perf is ~350 megs a second - ouch!
</p>


<div class="question">What does the compiled code look like?</div>

<p>
  Let's see how much binary code our JSON parser has generated. Since it compiles down to a whole bunch of tiny functions that get inlined heavily, this is slightly awkward to measure. We can instead compare binary sizes between versions of Matcheroni's JSON benchmark with the matcher and parser turned on/off. Some code is common to both the parser and the matcher, but we can do a bit of algebra to measure that as well:
</p>

<pre class = "centered text_box">

<div class="divider">Pitfalls & Caveats</div>
<p>
  Let's go over a few caveats about Matcheroni before we end the tutorial.
</p>

<div class="question">Using "using" = big debug symbols.</div>
<p>
  It's super convenient to build patterns with the C++ "using" keyword as seen above, but that's not always the best way to structure a larger parser.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately for us, the pattern names in using declarations and typedefs don't show up in the compiled binary's debug symbols, so your call stack will look like a big list of giant nested templates. This makes it nearly impossible to step through a matcher in a debugger because you can't easily look at the function name on the call stack and know where in the pattern you are.
</p>
<p>
  One workaround is to group patterns together like the first JsonMatcher example that matches numbers. Then when you declare <span class="highlight">"using foo = Some&lt;JsonMatcher&gt;..."</span>, at least you'll see "JsonMatcher::match" on the call stack if you need to debug it.
</p>
<p>
You can also have standalone matcher functions and wrap them in <span class="highlight">Ref&lt;&gt;</span> as needed - that does nearly the same thing.
</p>

<div class="question">Don't delete your source buffers.</div>
<p>
  Parseroni stores pointers into the source data (via NodeBase::span) - if you delete the source buffer you parsed, those spans will be invalid. Don't do that.
</p>

<div class="question">C++ stacks are finite</div>
<p>
  Matcheroni is a _recursive_ descent parser and keeps its temporary state on the call stack. Normally this will not be a problem, but as seen in two of the JSON conformance tests, malicious inputs (like a megabyte of '[' characters) _will_ cause a stack overflow.
</p>
<p>
  Don't use Matcheroni in these cases.
</p>
<div class="question">Oneof&lt;&gt; returns the _first_ match</div>
<p>
  If you translate a BNF or EBNF grammar directly into Matcheroni patterns, you will likely run into problems due to Matcheroni (like all implementations of Parsing Expression Grammars) always choosing the _first_ match in a <span class="highlight">Oneof&lt;&gt;</span> that matches and not the _longest_. So this pattern will not work as expected:
</p>
<span class="centered code_box language-cpp">using pattern = Oneof&lt;
  Lit&lt;"true"&gt;,
  Lit&lt;"truer"&gt;, // will never match
  Lit&lt;"truest"&gt; // will never match
&gt;;
</span>
<p>
  but this one will:
</p>
<span class="centered code_box language-cpp">using pattern = Oneof&lt;
  Lit&lt;"truest"&gt;,
  Lit&lt;"truer"&gt;,
  Lit&lt;"true"&gt;
&gt;;
</span>
<br>
<div class="question">Some&lt;Opt&lt;&gt;&gt; creates an infinite loop</div>
<p>
  <span class="highlight">Some&lt;&gt;/Any&lt;&gt;</span> keeps trying until its inner pattern fails; <span class="highlight">Opt&lt;&gt;</span> never fails but can return an empty match. Put the two together and you have an infinite loop.
</p>
<p>
  I strongly recommend that all your named patterns (number, string, keyword, etc) always match _something_, so that if you nest one inside a Some&lt;&gt; you don't inadvertently hang.
</p>
<div class="question">Suffixes can cause exponential parsing time</div>
<p>
Parsers are slow when they have to repeatedly back up, undo some work, and then continue down a different path. Getting 90% of the way through a pattern and then failing due to a mismatched suffix is a good way to accidentally cause an exponential increase in parse time without realizing it.
</p>
<p>
Here's a pattern from parseroni_test.cpp that intentionally exacerbates that behavior:
</p>
<span class="centered code_box language-cpp">using pattern =
Oneof&lt;
  Capture&lt;"plus",  Seq&lt;Atom&lt;'['&gt;, Ref&lt;match&gt;, Atom&lt;']'&gt;, Atom&lt;'+'&gt;&gt;, TestNode&gt;,
  Capture&lt;"minus", Seq&lt;Atom&lt;'['&gt;, Ref&lt;match&gt;, Atom&lt;']'&gt;, Atom&lt;'-'&gt;&gt;, TestNode&gt;,
  Capture&lt;"star",  Seq&lt;Atom&lt;'['&gt;, Ref&lt;match&gt;, Atom&lt;']'&gt;, Atom&lt;'*'&gt;&gt;, TestNode&gt;,
  Capture&lt;"slash", Seq&lt;Atom&lt;'['&gt;, Ref&lt;match&gt;, Atom&lt;']'&gt;, Atom&lt;'/'&gt;&gt;, TestNode&gt;,
  Capture&lt;"opt",   Seq&lt;Atom&lt;'['&gt;, Ref&lt;match&gt;, Atom&lt;']'&gt;, Atom&lt;'?'&gt;&gt;, TestNode&gt;,
  Capture&lt;"eq",    Seq&lt;Atom&lt;'['&gt;, Ref&lt;match&gt;, Atom&lt;']'&gt;, Atom&lt;'='&gt;&gt;, TestNode&gt;,
  Capture&lt;"none",  Seq&lt;Atom&lt;'['&gt;, Ref&lt;match&gt;, Atom&lt;']'&gt;&gt;, TestNode&gt;,
  Capture&lt;"atom",  Range&lt;'a','z'&gt;, TestNode&gt;
&gt;;
</span>
<p>
This pattern matches nested square brackets with a single letter in the middle, plus an optional operator after each right square bracket.
Parsing "[[[[[[a]]]]]]" with that pattern will produce 137,250 (!) temporary nodes that are created and then immediately deleted due to the lack of a suffix.
</p>
<p>
If you really need to match patterns like this, look at <span class="highlight">CaptureBegin&lt;&gt;</span> and <span class="highlight">CaptureEnd&lt;&gt;</span> instead of <span class="highlight">Capture&lt;&gt;</span> - they're slightly harder to use, but they allow you to change the node type at the end of a match depending on the suffix instead of at the beginning and then backtracking a bunch.
</p>




<div class="divider">Work-In-Progress C Parser</div>

<p>
  Lastly, here's a compiled version of the work-in-progress C parser for you to play with. No guarantees that it will work correctly or produce meaningful parse trees, but it has been tested against GCC's library of C torture tests and it at least doesn't crash.

<div class="divider">Closing remarks</div>
<p>
Matcheroni and Parseroni were written to support my own experiments in parsing source code and translating it into other languages. They seem to work surprisingly well - I was really _not_ expecting to see gigabyte-per-second parse rates from JSON when I started putting this tutorial together.
</p>
<p>
I'm very curious to see if people find these tools useful - particularly if it finds some uses in matching/parsing things other than text. Handling binary data in particular could be interesting - there are plenty of other tools to do that, but Matcheroni could potentially allow for parsing text formats with embedded binary data in a cleaner way.
</p>
<p>
  I'm also interested in seeing what other programming languages can support a Matcheroni-like syntax. Python and Javascript would be obvious options and since they don't need a compilation phase they could be quite dynamic. Rust would be a very interesting option but it doesn't have variadic templates. I'm not sure how I'd put together a user-friendly mix of Rust macros and generics without things getting really weird. OCaml probably has something like Matcheroni built in already :D.
